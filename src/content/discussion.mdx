## Discussion and Limitations

Our combined action-chunking, noise-injection procedure relies on a structural assumption of either $f$ or $f^{\pi^\star}$ being EISS.

Without either of these assumptions, if $f^{\pi^\star}$ is unstable, errors may always compound in the worst-case [@simchowitz2025pitfalls]. This setting is, to some degree, uninteresting for Imitation Learning, as it means that the expert is inherently bad and cannot correct from failure. 

For settings where an external oracle can stabilize the dynamics (e.g. a low-level position-based control loop), the dynamics can be reformulated such that $f$ is open-loop EISS. As such, we believe our results cover the full spectrum of situations where learning is reasonable.
